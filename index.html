                In this article we cover the absolute basics of HTML. To get you started, this article defines elements, attributes, and all the other important terms you may have heard. It also explains where these fit into HTML. You will learn how HTML elements are structured, how a typical HTML page is structured, and other important basic language features.

        <section class="main-section" id="What_is_HTML?">
            <header><h1>What is HTML?</h1></header>

            <article>
            <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is a <em>markup language</em> that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or <em>mark up</em> different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the following line of text:</p>
        
            <code class="widecode">
                My cat is very grumpy
            </code>
    
            <p>
                If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph (<code class="wordcode">&lt;p&gt;</code>) element:
            </p>
    
            <code class="widecode">
                &lt;<span class="tag">p</span>&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/<span class="tag">p</span>&gt;
            </code>
    
            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Tags in HTML are case-insensitive. This means they can be written in uppercase or lowercase. For example, a 
                <code class="wordcode">&lt;title&gt;</code>
                tag could be written as
                <code class="wordcode">&lt;title&gt;</code>,
                <code class="wordcode">&lt;TITLE&gt;</code>,
                <code class="wordcode">&lt;Title&gt;</code>,
                <code class="wordcode">&lt;TiTLE&gt;</code>,
                etc., and it will work. However, it is best practice to write all tags in lowercase for consistency and readability.

        <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_Element">
            <header><h1>Anatomy of an HTML Element</h1></header>

            <article>
            <p>
                Let's further explore our paragraph element from the previous section:
            </p>

            <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/grumpy-cat-small.png" id="grumpy-cat-small" alt="Syntax of a paragraph tag">
                <p>
                    The anatomy of our element is:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this example, <em>p</em> for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brankets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.</li>
                    <li><strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.</li>
                    <li><strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it incluues a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.</li>
                </ul>
                The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.

            <h3>Nesting Elements</h3>

            <p>
                Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called <em>nesting</em>. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word <em>very</em> in a <code class="wordcode">&lt;strong&gt;</code> element, which means that the word is to have strong(er) text formatting:

            </p>

                <code class="widecode">&lt;<span class="tag">p</span>&gt;My cat is &lt;<span class="tag">strong</span>&gt;very&lt;/<span class="tag">strong</span>&gt; grumpy.&lt;/<span class="tag">p</span>&gt;</code>

            <p>
                There is a right and wrong way to do nesting. In the example above, we opened the <code class="wordcode">p</code> element first, then opened the <code class="wordcode">strong</code> element. For proper nesting, we should close the <code class="wordcode">strong</code> element first before closing the <code class="wordcode">p</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The following is an example of the <em>wrong</em> way to do nesting:
            </p>

            <code class="widecode">
                &lt;<span class="tag">p</span>&gt;My cat is &lt;<span class="tag">strong</span>&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/<span class="tag">p</span>&gt;&lt;/<span class="tag">strong</span>&gt;
            </code>

            <p>
                The tags have to open and close in a way that they are inside or outside one another. With the kind of overlap in the example above, the browser has to guess at your intent. This kind of guessing can result in unexpected results.
            </p>

            <h3>Block versus inline elements</h3>

            <p>
                There are two important categories of elements to know in HTML: block-level elements and inline elements.
            </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Block-level elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level element appears on a new line forming the content that precedes it. Any content that follows a block-level element also appears on a new line. Block-level elements are usually structural elements on the page. For example, a block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, or footers. A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside another block-level element.</li>

                    <li>
                        Inline elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts of the document's content (not entire paragraphs or groupings of content). An inline element will not cause a new line to appear in the document. It is typically used with text, for example an <code class="wordcode">&lt;a&gt;</code> element creates a hyperlink, and elements such as <code class="wordcode">&lt;em&gt;</code> or <code class="wordcode">&lt;strong&gt;</code> create emphasis.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            
            <p>
                Consider the following example:
            </p>

            <code class="widecode">
                &lt;<span class="tag">em</span>&gt;first&lt;/<span class="tag">em</span>&gt;&lt;<span class="tag">em</span>&gt;second&lt;/<span class="tag">em</span>&gt;&lt;<span class="tag">em</span>&gt;third&lt;/<span class="tag">em</span>&gt;
                <br><br>
                &lt;<span class="tag">p</span>&gt;fourth&lt;/<span class="tag">p</span>&gt;&lt;<span class="tag">p</span>&gt;fifth&lt;/<span class="tag">p</span>&gt;&lt;<span class="tag">p</span>&gt;sixth&lt;/<span class="tag">p</span>&gt;
            </code>

            <p>
                <code class="wordcode">&lt;em&gt;</code>
                is an inline element. As you see below, the first three elements sit on the same line, with no space in between. On the other hand,
                <code class="wordcode">&lt;p&gt;</code> 
                is a block-level element. Each <em>p</em> element appears on a new line, with space above and below. (The spacing is due to default CSS styling that the browser applies to paragraphs.)
            </p>

            <code class="widecode">
                <em>firstsecondthird</em>
                <br><br>
                    fourth
                
                <br><br>
                    fifth
                
                <br><br>
                    sixth
                
            </code>

            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> The terms <em>block</em> and <em>inline</em>, as used in this article, should not be confused with the types of CSS boxes that have the same names. While the names correlate by default, changing the CSS display type doesn't change the category of the element, and doesn't affect which elements it can contain and which elements it can be contained in.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Empty Elements
            </h3>

            <p>
                Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements consist of a single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed something in the document. For example, the
                <code class="wordcode">&lt;img&gt;</code> 
                element embeds an image file onto a page:
            </p>

            <code class="widecode">
                &lt;<span class="tag">img</span> <span class="attr">src</span>="<span class="quotes">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png</span>"&gt;
            </code>

            <p>
                This would output the following:
            </p>

            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png" id="firefox-icon" alt="Firefox icon">

            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Empty elements are sometimes called <em>void elements</em>.
            </p>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
            <header><h1>Attributes</h1></header>

            <article>
            <p>
                Elements can also have attributes. Attributes look like this:
            </p>

            <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" id="grumpy-cat-attribute" alt="Syntax of element attributes">

            <p>
                Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the
                <code class="wordcode">class</code> attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.
            </p>

            <p>
                An attribute should have:
            </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attribute should be separated by spaces too.)</li>
                    <li>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</li>
                    <li>An attribuet name, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.</li>
                </ul>
            

            <h3 id="Adding-Attributes-to-an-Element">Adding Attributes to an Element</h3>

            <p>
                Another example of an element is 
                <code class="wordcode">&lt;a&gt;</code>
                . This stands for <em>anchor</em>. An anchor can make the text it encloses into a hyperlink. Anchors can take a number of attributes, but several are as follows:
            </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code class="wordcode"><strong>href</strong></code>
                        : This attribute's value specifies the web address for the link. For example:
                        <code class="wordcode">href="https://www.mozilla.org/"</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code class="wordcode"><strong>title</strong></code>
                        : The 
                        <code class="wordcode">title</code> 
                        attribute specifies extra information about the link, such as a description of the page that is being linked to. For example, 
                        <code class="wordcode">title="The Mozilla homepage"</code>
                        . This appears as a tooltip when a cursor hovers over the element.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code class="wordcode"><strong>target</strong></code>
                        : The 
                        <code class="wordcode">target</code> 
                        attribute specifies the browsing context used to display the link. For example, 
                        <code class="wordcode">target="_blank"</code> 
                        will display the link in a new tab. If you want to display the linked content in the current tab, just omit this attribute.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h3>
                Boolean attributes
            </h3>

            <p>
                Sometimes you will see attributes written without values. This is entirely acceptable. These are called Boolean attributes. Boolean attributes can only have one value, which is generally the same as the attribute name. For example, consider the 
                <code class="wordcode">disabled</code> 
                attribute, which you can assign to form input elements. (You use this to <em>disable</em> the form input elements so the user can't make entries. The disabled elements typically have a grayed-out appearance.) For example:
            </p>

            <code class="wordcode">&lt;<span class="tag">input</span> <span class="attr">type</span>="<span class="quotes">text</span>" <span class="attr">disabled</span>="<span class="quotes">disabled</span>"&gt;</code>
            
            <p>
                As shorthand, it is acceptable to write this as follows:
            </p>

            <code class="widecode">
                
                    <span class="comment">&lt;!-- Using the disabled attribute pevents the end user from entering text into the input box --&gt;</span>
                    <br>

                <br><br>

                
                    <span class="comment">&lt;!-- text input is allowed, as it doesn't contain the disabled attribute --&gt;</span>

            <p>
                For reference, the example above also includes a non-disabled form input element. The HTML from the example above produces this result:
            </p>

            <input type="text" disabled>
            <input type="text">

            <h3>
                Omitting quotes around attribute values
            </h3>

            <p>
                If you look at code for a lot of other sites, you might come across a number of strange markup styles, including attribute values without quotes. This is permitted in certain circumstances, but it can also break your markup in other circumstances. For example, if we revisit our link example from earlier, we could write a basic version with <em>only</em> the 
                <code class="wordcode">href</code> 
                attribute, like this:
            </p>

            <pre><code class="widecode">&lt;<span class="tag">a</span> <span class="attr">href</span>=<span class="quotes">https://www.mozilla.org/</span>&gt;favorite website&lt;/<span class="tag">a</span>&gt;</code></pre>
            
            <p>
                However, as soon as we add the 
                <code class="wordcode">title</code> 
                attribute in this way, there are problems:
            </p>

            <pre><code class="redcode">&lt;<span class="tag">a</span> <span class="attr">href</span>=<span class="quotes">https://www.mozilla.org/</span> <span class="attr">title</span>=<span class="quotes">The Mozilla homepage</span>&gt;favorite website&lt;/<span class="tag">a</span>&gt;</code></pre>

            <p>
                As written above, the browser misinterprets the markup, mistaking the 
                <code class="wordcode">title</code> 
                attribute for three attributes: a title attribute with the value <em>The</em>, and two Boolean attributes, 
                <code class="wordcode">Mozilla</code> 
                and 
                <code class="wordcode">homepage</code>
                . Obviously, this is not intended! It will cause errors or unexpected behavior, as you can see in the live example below. Try hovering over the link to view the title text!
            </p>

                <pre><a href=https://www.mozilla.org>favorite website</a> <a href=https://www.mozilla.org/ title=The Mozilla homepage>favorite website</a></pre>

            <p>
                Always include the attribute quotes. It acoids such problems, and results in more readable code.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Single or double quotes?
            </h3>

            <p>
                In this article you will also notice that the attributes are wrapped in double quotes. However, you might see single quotes in some HTML code. This is a matter of style. You can feel free to choose which one you prefer. Both of these lines are equivalent:
            </p>

            <code class="widecode">
                    &lt;<span class="tag">a</span> <span class="attr">href</span>="<span class="quotes">https://www.example.com</span>"&gt;A link to my example.&lt;/<span class="tag">a</span>&gt;
                    <br><br>
                    &lt;<span class="tag">a</span> <span class="attr">href</span>='<span class="quotes">https://www.example.com</span>'&gt;A link to my example.&lt;/<span class="tag">a</span>&gt;
                
            </code>

            <p>
                Make sure you don't mix single quotes and double quotes. This example (below) shows a kind of mixing quotes that will go wrong.
            </p>

            <code class="redcode">
                &lt;<span class="tag">a</span> <span class="attr">href</span>="<span class="quotes">https://www.example.com</span>'&gt;A link to my example.&lt;/<span class="tag">a</span>&gt;
            </code>

            <p>
                However, if you use one type of quote, you can include the other type of quote <em>inside</em> your attribute values:
            </p>

            <code class="widecode">
                &lt;<span class="tag">a</span> <span class="attr">href</span>="<span class="quotes">https://www.example.com</span>" <span class="attr">title</span>="<span class="quotes">Isn't this fun?</span>"&gt;A link to my example.&lt;/<span class="tag">a</span>&gt;
            </code>

            <p>
                To use quote marks inside other quote marks of the same type (single quote or double quote), use HTML entities. For example, this will break:
            </p>

            <code class="redcode">
                &lt;<span class="tag">a</span> <span class="attr">href</span>='<span class="quotes">https://www.example.com</span>' <span class="attr">title</span>='<span class="quotes">Isn't this fun?</span>'&gt;A link to my example.&lt;/<span class="tag">a</span>&gt;
            </code>

            <p>
                Instead, you need to do this:
            </p>

            <code class="widecode">
                &lt;<span class="tag">a</span> <span class="attr">href</span>='<span class="quotes">https://www.example.com</span>' <span class="attr">title</span>='<span class="quotes">Isn&amp;apos;t this fun?</span>'&gt;A link to my example.&lt;/<span class="tag">a</span>&gt;

                Individual HTML elements aren't very useful on their own. Next, let's examine how individual elements combine to form an entire HTML page:
            </p>
            
            <pre><code class="widecode">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>&lt;<span class="tag">html</span>&gt;<br>  &lt;<span class="tag">head</span>&gt;<br>    &lt;<span class="tag">meta</span> <span class="attr">charset</span>="<span class="quotes">utf-8</span>"&gt;<br>    &lt;<span class="tag">title</span>&gt;My test page&lt;/<span class="tag">title</span>&gt;<br>  &lt;/<span class="tag">head</span>&gt;<br>  &lt;<span class="tag">body</span>&gt;<br>    &lt;<span class="tag">p</span>&gt;This is my page&lt;/<span class="tag">p</span>&gt;<br>  &lt;/<span class="tag">body</span>&gt;<br>&lt;/<span class="tag">html</span>&gt;</code></pre>

            <p>
                Here we have:
            </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <code class="wordcode">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>: The doctype. When HTML was young (1991 - 1992), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML. Doctypes used to look something like this: <br>

                        <code class="widecode">
                            &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
                            "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"&gt;
                        </code>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        More recently, the doctype is a historical artifact that needs to be included for everything else to work right. <code class="wordcode">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> is the shortest string of characters that counts as a valid doctype. That is all you need to know!
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <code class="wordcode">&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code>: The <code class="wordcode">&lt;html&gt;</code> element. This element wraps all the content on the page. It is sometimes known as the root element.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <code class="wordcode">&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code>: The <code class="wordcode">&lt;head&gt;</code> element. This element acts as a container for everything you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content the page will show to viewers. This includes keywords and a page description that would appear in search results, CSS to style content, character set declarations, and more.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code class="wordcode">&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</code>: This element specifies the character set for your document to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of human written languages. With this setting, the page can now handle any textual content it might contain. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <code class="wordcode">&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</code>: The <code class="wordcode">&lt;title&gt;</code> element. This sets the title of the page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. The page title is also used to describe the page when it is bookmarked.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <code class="wordcode">&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code>: The <code class="wordcode">&lt;body&gt;</code> element. This contains <em>all the content</em> that displays on the page, including text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.

                If you want to experiment with writing some HTML on your local computer, you can:
            </p>

                <ol>

                        Just below the opening tag of the <code class="wordcode">&lt;body&gt;</code> element, add a main title for the document. This should be wrapped inside an <code class="wordcode">&lt;h1&gt;</code> opening tag and <code class="wordcode">&lt;/h1&gt;</code> closing tag.

            <h3>
                Whitespace in HTML
            </h3>

            <p>
                In the examples above, you may have noticed that a lot of whitespace is included in the code. This is optional. These two code snippets are equivalent:
            </p>

            <pre><code class="widecode">&lt;<span class="tag">p</span>&gt;Dogs are silly.&lt;/<span class="tag">p</span>&gt;<br><br>&lt;<span class="tag">p</span>&gt;Dogs          are
                silly.&lt;/<span class="tag">p</span>&gt;</code></pre>
            
            <p>
                No matter how much whitespace you use inside HTML element content (which can include one or more space character, but also line breaks), the HTML parser reduces each sequence of whitespace to a single space when rendering the code. So why use so much whitespace? The answer is readability.
            </p>

            <p>
                It can be easier to understand what is going on in your code if you have it nicely formatted. In our HTML we've got each nested element indented by two spaces more than the one it is sitting inside. It is up to you to choose the style of formatting (how many spaces for each level of indentation, for example), but you should consider formatting it.

                In HTML, the characters <code class="wordcode">&lt;</code>, <code class="wordcode">&gt;</code>, <code class="wordcode">"</code>, <code class="wordcode">'</code>, and <code class="wordcode">&</code> are special characters. They are parts of the HTML syntax. So how do you include one of these special characters in your text? For example, if you want to use an ampersand or less-than sign, and not have it interpreted as code.
            </p>

            <p>
                You do this with character references. These are special codes that represent characters, to be useful in these exact circumstances. Each character reference starts with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;).

                The character reference could be easily remembered because the text it uses can be seen as less than for '&amp;lt;', quotation for '&amp;quot;' and similarly for others.

            <p>
                In the example below, there are two paragraphs:
            </p>

            <code class="widecode">
                
                    &lt;<span class="tag">p</span>&gt;In HTML, you define a paragraph using the &lt;<span class="tag">p</span>&gt; element.&lt;/<span class="tag">p</span>&gt;

            </code>
            
            <p>
                In the live output below, you can see that the first paragraph has gone wrong. The browser interprets the second instance of <code class="wordcode">&lt;p&gt;</code> as starting a new paragraph. The second paragraph looks fine because it has angle brackets with character references.
            </p>

            <p>
                In HTML, you define a paragraph using the <p> element.

            <p>
                In HTML, you define a paragraph using the &lt;p&gt; element.

        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="HTML_comments">
            <header><h1>HTML comments</h1></header>

            <article>
            <p>
                HTML has a mechanism to write comments in the code. Browsers ignore comments, effectively making comments invisible to the user. The purpose of comments is to allow you to include notes in the code to explain your logic or coding. This is very useful if you return to a code base after being away for long enough that you don't completely remember it. Likewise, comments are invaluable as different people are making changes and updates.
            </p>

            <p>
                To write an HTML comment, wrap it in the special markers <code class="wordcode">&lt;!--</code> and <code class="wordcode">--&gt;</code>. For example:
            </p>
            
            <code class="widecode">
                    &lt;<span class="tag">p</span>&gt;I'm not inside a comment&lt;/<span class="tag">p</span>&gt;
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="comment">&lt;!-- &lt;p&gt;I am!&lt;/p&gt; --&gt;</span>
            </code>

            <p>
                As you can see below, only the first paragraph displays in the live output.
            </p>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Summary">
            <header><h1>Summary</h1></header>

            <article>
            <p>
                You made it to the end of the article! We hope you enjoyed your tour of the basics of HTML.
            </p>

            <p>
                At this point, you should understand what HTML looks like, and how it works at a basic level. You should also be able to write a few elements and attributes. The more you practice, the more you'll feel comfortable with HTML!
